# Web-Tool MST Dry weights
A project done as part of internship - Web tool to report the dry weight values

Task:
To create a new version of the existing MST Dry Weight web page, and enhance querying Teradata, and provide a single reportable package dry weight value for the customer facing group.

Result:
Created a new enhanced web page to accommodate the requested enhancements to the existing tool. The new web page queries the Teradata BE data warehouse, as it's primary source to leverage existing data sources. This eliminated the existing MS Access database that required MST dry weight data to be stored in multiple locations.
